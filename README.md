# elliesch.github.io

The setup and source code for this site was made using the tutorial at [Jonathan McGlone's blog](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) and the tutorial at [Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com/learn/a-guide-to-using-github-pages/) as guides and references.
It uses a combination of [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), and of course html and css.

Please feel free to use my source code as a reference for creating your own site.
