	<p>My first project in astronomy research will always hold a warm place in my heart. As part of an NSF sponsored program at the Museum of Natural History, Victoria DiTomasso (Hunter College, Class of 2018), and I reduced high-resolution spectroscopic infrared data for 11 nearby, candidate young brown dwarfs. We then measured the radial velocities (RVs) of all 11 objects by cross-correlating their spectra with known RV standard dwarfs of matching spectral types. We used these RVs along with parallax distances and proper motions to confirm young moving group candidacy for three of the brown dwarfs. I presented a poster on this project at the 227th meeting of the AAS and won a <a href="https://aas.org/posts/news/2016/01/chambliss-student-poster-awards-aas-227">Chambliss Astronomy Award for Best Poster</a> for my presentation.</p>
	
	<h3>Radio Explorations in Ultracool Dwarf Magnetism</h3>

	For my undergraduate thesis I decided to combine two of my favorite things: magnetic fields and ultracool dwarfs (UCDs). UCDs have surprisingly strong magnetic fields considering that they are fully convective and their atmospheres are electrically neutral. I compiled a sample of previously observed radio luminosities for ~200 UCDs and using rigorous Bayesian statistics, I have analyzed their radio luminosity as linear functions of several fundamental parameters. I am now working to use these initial relationships as priors to run tests for more complex relationships which can provide constraints to current UCD dynamo theory. I presented a poster on my work so far at Cool Stars 19, and I will be defending my thesis in the Spring of 2017.</p>
