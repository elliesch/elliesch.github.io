	<p>My first project in astronomy research will always hold a warm place in my heart. As part of an NSF sponsored program at the Museum of Natural History, another astronomy student, Victoria DiTomasso, and I reduced high-resolution spectroscopic infrared data for 11 nearby, candidate young brown dwarfs. We then measured the radial velocities (RVs) of all 11 objects by cross-correlating their spectra with known RV standard dwarfs of matching spectral types. We used these RVs along with parallax distances and proper motions to confirm young moving group candidacy for three of the brown dwarfs. I presented a poster on this project at the 227th meeting of the AAS and won a <a href="https://aas.org/posts/news/2016/01/chambliss-student-poster-awards-aas-227">Chambliss Astronomy Award for Best Poster</a> for my presentation.</p>
