	<p>My first project in astronomy research will always hold a warm place in my heart. 
	As part of Astrocom NYC, an NSF sponsored program at the American Museum of Natural History, Victoria DiTomasso (Hunter College, Class of 2018), and I worked with Dr. Emily Rice of the BDNYC Collaboration.
	Wereduced high-resolution spectroscopic infrared data for 11 nearby, candidate young brown dwarfs and measured their radial velocities using cross-correlation techniques. 
	We used these RVs along with parallax distances and proper motions to confirm young moving group candidacy for three of the brown dwarfs. 
	I presented a poster on this project at the 227th meeting of the AAS and won a <a href="https://aas.org/posts/news/2016/01/chambliss-student-poster-awards-aas-227">Chambliss Astronomy Award for Best Poster</a> for my presentation.</p>
	
	<h3>Radio Explorations in Ultracool Dwarf Magnetism</h3>
	<p><img src="/images/cool_stars_poster.jpg" alt="My poster at the Cool Stars 19 Conference" style="float:left; height:400px; padding-right: 30px;">
	For my undergraduate thesis project I decided to combine two of my favorite things: magnetic fields and ultracool dwarfs (UCDs). 
	UCDs have surprisingly strong magnetic fields considering that they are fully convective and their atmospheres are electrically neutral. 
	Working with Dr. Kelle Cruz, I compiled a sample of previously observed radio luminosities for ~200 UCDs and using rigorous Bayesian statistics, I have analyzed their radio luminosity as linear functions of several fundamental parameters. 
	I am now working to use these initial relationships as priors to run tests for more complex relationships which can provide constraints to current UCD dynamo theory. 
	I presented a poster on my work so far at Cool Stars 19 in Sweden and first authored <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/163668/files/eschwab_CS19proceedings.pdf">journal paper</a> in the Cool Stars proceedings.
	I will be defending my thesis in the Spring of 2017.</p>
