		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>I am a nontraditional undergraduate student studying physics in the <a href="http://macaulay.cuny.edu">Macaulay Honors Program</a> at the <a href="https://www.ccny.cuny.edu">City College of New York</a> (CCNY), the <a href=http://www2.cuny.edu>City University of New York</a>’s (CUNY’s) Harlem campus. The first of my siblings to pursue a degree, I began college in my late twenties to fulfill a burning desire to know more about the workings of the universe around me. I have always been a deeply curious person, and I have found a home for that curiosity in the physics and astronomy community.
		</br>I am interested in the extreme environments the cosmos provide for studying elementary physical phenomena, particularly in the overlap between electromagnetic theory and astrophysical structure. I study some of this overlap as a member of the <a href="http://www.bdnyc.org">Brown Dwarfs in New York City</a> (BDNYC) Collaboration at the American Museum of Natural History. With Dr. Kelle Cruz, I research how the radio luminosity of very low mass stars and brown dwarfs depends on these objects’ fundamental parameters. This research can offer constraints on ultracool dwarf dynamos, which are challenging to understand given their electrically neutral atmospheres and fully-convective internal structures.
		</br> I also spent the summer researching with the <a href="http://nanograv.org">North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves</a> (NANOGrav) Collaboration under Dr. Scott Ransom at <a href="http://www.nrao.edu">NRAO</a> to aid in the search for gravitational wave signatures from galactic pulsar timing arrays. Using a dataset collected continuously for over a decade, I explore methods to better constrain the error source in the measured arrival times of millisecond pulsar beams. This work seeks to achieve a precision in uncertainty that pushes the very limit of current observational capability. Such precision is necessary to disentangle galactic-scale gravitational wave signatures from magnetospherically driven pulsar emission fluctuations, interference from the interstellar medium, or instrumental effects.
		</br>As CCNY’s only astronomer, I am working with a group of other CCNY student physicists and engineers to restore our campus’s long-unused planetarium. I have teamed up with another student astronomer from CUNY - Hunter College to direct the planetarium and to create programming that makes astronomy interesting and accessible to students across the greater CUNY university system. Our programs not only work to provide planetarium shows and amateur astronomy nights on the local night sky, but also to introduce students to the broader research of astronomers from all over New York City.</p>
